# Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator in C

This C program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers entered by the user. It prompts the user to input two integers and then computes their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
gcc gcd_calculator.c -o gcd_calculator
2. Run the compiled executable:
./gcd_calculator
3. Enter two integers separated by a space.

## Example
$ ./gcd_calculator
24 36
12

## Note
- The program uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.
